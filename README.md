<h1>Windows & Linux VM Communication on Azure with 
Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis)</h1>

Computer networking – Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of two virtual machines — one running Windows Server and the other Linux (Ubuntu) — in Microsoft Azure, with the objective of enabling secure network communication between them. The primary goal is to simulate cross-platform communication within a cloud environment and analyze the network traffic using Wireshark.

By capturing and inspecting packets, I was able to observe key protocols in action (such as ICMP, SSH, RDP, DNS, and HTTP), evaluate latency, and understand how data moves between systems at a deeper level.

This project bridges cloud infrastructure, operating system administration, and network analysis, making it relevant for roles in cloud operations, cybersecurity, and system administration.


<h1>Skills Demonstrated</h1>

<p>

__1.) Azure Infrastructure Management__

Deployed and configured virtual machines in Azure

Set up virtual networks (VNets), subnets, and security groups

</p>

<br>

<p>

__2.) Cross-Platform System Administration__

Configured a Windows Server and Ubuntu Linux environment

Installed and managed services such as SSH, RDP, and Apache
</p>

<br>


<p>
__3.) Network Security & Access Control__

Created and tested firewall rules using Azure NSGs (Network Security Groups)

Controlled traffic flow and verified security boundaries
</p>

<br>

<p>
__4.) Network Traffic Capture & Analysis (Wireshark)__

Captured packets on both VMs

Analyzed traffic protocols (TCP/IP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)

Identified key packet headers, handshakes, and data flow patterns

</p>

<br>

<p>
__5.) Documentation & Reporting__

Documented VM setup steps, firewall rules, and traffic test results

Provided screenshots and .pcap files for proof-of-concept

<br>

<p>

__6.) Use Cases__
Understanding real-world cloud network communication

Practicing network traffic analysis and protocol inspection

Gaining hands-on experience with Azure virtual networking

Demonstrating knowledge in both Windows and Linux environments
